## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
    - (Sketched in notebook)
-   The data structure you plan to use.
    - I'd really like to have a good looking home page with nav bars and maybe an aside with some history of Tic Tac Toe.
    - I'll keep the gameboard in the center since it is the main feature.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    - The HTML will help dictate the JS logic. Will need to think about this some more.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
    - After designing the wireframe for the project, I'll build out the HTML and CSS.
    - Once the basic structure is in place, I'll add in the game logic with JS.
    - Lastly, I'll build in the ability to create user names.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    - As a user, I'd like to have the ability to keep track of score so I can see who's winning.
    - As a user, I'd like to create a username and password so I can return to the game later.
    - As a user, I'd like to play as many games as I'd like without having to refresh the page so I can play without interuption.
    - As a user, I'd like to be able to change my password and signout so I can better manage my account.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    - I'll try to separate code into files that make the most sense instead of keeping it all in one file.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
    - I would really like the game to be compatible with mobile devices.
    - I think it would also be cool if players can customize their markers on the gameboard.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
    - I'll need to commit early and often! For each feature I'll make sure to make commits so that I can better keep track of my work.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
    - Outside of getting it to work on mobile devices, my primary focus is to make sure I can apply the basics I've learned over the past 2 weeks to build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
